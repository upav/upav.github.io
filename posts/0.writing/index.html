    <p>For the first post here I thought, I&rsquo;ll go thru how and why I started writing and how it led to creating this website.</p>
<p>Writing came into my life quite recently, couple of years ago, I would say.
It was when a lot of my friends started to create personal telegram channels, I thought &ldquo;Wow! This is so cool, I could do the same but don&rsquo;t really know what to write about&hellip;&rdquo;.
Then during more depressive periods of my life, when being in emotional states, I could really understand how I feel and why I feel that way.
That was the first time the pen and paper came to the rescue!
I started asking myself questions and write bullet point with anything that comes up.
I was able to take a step back and look at the inifinitely confusing world inside of me, which did help me quite a lot during a few low moments of my life, but wasn&rsquo;t enough for me to start writing yet..</p>
<p>This is where my friend Vlad came and told me that he&rsquo;ll be creating a blog.
Probably because I was scared of writing myself, I thought it was a bad idea, but it did remind me of the blog as the method of communication.</p>
<p>Some months later I suddenly realised that I already have a blog! At work.
We have an internal &ldquo;blog&rdquo; space for writing documentation withing a company and to share our opinions.
Every time I had to create a page I would come to it artistically, think of a cool heading, images I&rsquo;m gonna use and jokes I&rsquo;m gonna put in there.
It was a great way to express myself and I enjoyed it everytime I had a chance.
So I was already a blogger, just mostly technical and my blog was only visible to my colleagues.</p>
<p>The last thing that made my mind was an Artist&rsquo;s way programm.
My friend suggested me to join their group reading the book and doing weekly catch-ups.
I won&rsquo;t go into the details of the bokk, just say that I do recomend it.
Julia Cameron, look here up.
As part of the program, you have to promise yourself that you will write 3 pages of text every morning.
Now that sounded terrifying!
Like every day? My life is not that interesting! I won&rsquo;t have anything to write about!
Still, something inside me felt like I need to take the challenge, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Fast forward 2 months, here I am, creating a blog because I wrote so many interesting reflections, I don&rsquo;t wanna lose them in the endless streams of consciousness in my notebooks.
So what happened between &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too scared to write&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have so my writings on paper, I need to digitise some of them so I don&rsquo;t lose my thoughts&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Apparently, there&rsquo;s no wrong way to write a diary/journal/morning pages (call it however you like)!
Which sounds easy but only before you actually sit down and start writing on a regular basis.
I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of some specific ways society raises us or it&rsquo;s just a way how the brain works by itself, but we really like to create rules!
For no apparent reason. We think that the what we create was to be a particular way, which is different depending on a person.
Daily writing hepled me to dissosiate those preconceptions and let me think and write without filtering the information because it doesn&rsquo;t have to be anything in particular anymore!
One other thing I had to face in my way was the fear. Fear of not having anything to write about.
The number of times I sat in my chair in the morning thinking I have nothing to write about and wrote all my pages with a great passion is astounishing.
I still have days when I think I won&rsquo;t be able to write much but now I know to sit and do it anyway and quite often I see that I still have things I can express.
The truth is, we are always thinking anyway. Constantly.
Why can&rsquo;t I write my thoughts even if they don&rsquo;t mean much or don&rsquo;t relate to my life as much as I want them to be?
Then you start to notice that all these things are not so random, not in a sense you would think they are.
Most of thoughts actually come from feelings.
So when you are practicing to look at your unfiltered thoughts, you&rsquo;re actually looking at your emotions and feelings.
And just like I did earlier with using bullet points for explaining my emothional states, I&rsquo;m now using morning pages to better understand my usual states.
There&rsquo;s something about structure here, when you need to put things on paper, you need to put whatever you feel into words and some sort of sentences, for which you need to take a step back and ask yourself some quesitons, whether counsciously or subconsciously.</p>
<p>So the more pages I wrote the more honest I could be with myself, so I could get even deeper into my emotions, which opened a whole other door of seeing myself in the way I haven&rsquo;t before.
Soon enough, I started seeing difference in my life outside the pages.
I&rsquo;ve started feeling more intimate with myself and other people.
I was able to see my insecurities for what they are and didn&rsquo;t need other people to give me reassuarance, which I hope made their time with me a bit more pleasant.
I say that, but I don&rsquo;t actually think I&rsquo;ve figured out all my insecurities but defenetely some of them.
So, it&rsquo;s a great start!</p>
<p>So this is what&rsquo;s been happening to this day.
The thought of being able to put some of my reflections and stories somewhere where I can easily acess them and share with other people been terrorising me for the last couple of weeks.
I knew I needed a blog.
Even if noone reads it, it&rsquo;s there for myself.
Luckly for me, my friend Vlad already went through the process of creating a blog and wrote a <a href="https://vladisl0th.github.io/blog/0.helloworld/">blog post</a> about it!
If you are interested, give it a read, it&rsquo;s a relatively easy way to setup your blog/website and host it for free.
It will require being somewhat comfortable with the command line, basic knowledge of git/github and being curious and brave!
Why not give it a try? I can help you if you want.</p>
<p>Love all, see you next time.</p>
