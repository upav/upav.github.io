  <meta property="og:description" content="As I was walking home with a coffee in my hand, I was enjoing the autumn beauty of Bristol and being slightly nervous about not doing work at 11am.
“You’ll take a sick day if you don’t do anything today”, I kept telling myself.
As I was in my head thinking about work and how beautiful everything is, I saw a old short woman walking towards me. As I was approaching her, she started talking to me. I didn’t quite catch the beggining of it but it quickly became:
“… these people … narcotics … devil city … they don’t do anything about it”.
She’s been saying a lot of words with a thick slavic accent. Being caught by surprise and not expeting this conversation go beyond a casual two-phrase interaction, I didn’t catch most of the things she was saying. I guess I thought that at some point she’ll stop and I’ll have a chance to give her a generic responce to continue my morning in the blessed silence.
I was so naive, haha.
Hearing she’s talking about “narcotics”, I figured I need to start thinking of my way out of this conversation or I’ll be here for long.">

    <p>As I was walking home with a coffee in my hand,
I was enjoing the autumn beauty of Bristol and being slightly nervous about not doing work at 11am.<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take a sick day if you don&rsquo;t do anything today&rdquo;, I kept telling myself.<br>
As I was in my head thinking about work and how beautiful everything is,
I saw a old short woman walking towards me.
As I was approaching her, she started  talking to me.
I didn&rsquo;t quite catch the beggining of it but it quickly became:<br>
&ldquo;&hellip; these people &hellip; narcotics &hellip; devil city &hellip; they don&rsquo;t do anything about it&rdquo;.<br>
She&rsquo;s been saying a lot of words with a thick slavic accent.
Being caught by surprise and not expeting this conversation go beyond a casual two-phrase interaction,
I didn&rsquo;t catch most of the things she was saying.
I guess I thought that at some point she&rsquo;ll stop and
I&rsquo;ll have a chance to give her a generic responce to continue my morning in the blessed silence.<br>
I was so naive, haha.<br>
Hearing she&rsquo;s talking about &ldquo;narcotics&rdquo;,
I figured I need to start thinking of my way out of this conversation or I&rsquo;ll be here for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the food in here. You go to the shop and there&rsquo;s nothing good!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;&hellip; my friend. She has problems with her partner. I don&rsquo;t wanna talk about her personal things.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I went to the coffee shop, there were two: a man and a woman near me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been jumping from one thing to another without a lot of transition.
It really felt like an unfiltered stream of consciousness which has no end to it.
Nothing she&rsquo;s been saying could possibly reach any sort of logical end of conversation.
To be honest, there were not much conversation there in the first place.
Now I realised that I&rsquo;m here for long.
Still worrying about work, I decided to at least play along and try to enjoy this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say Russia is bad but England is also bad!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;See this church? It used to be a church, now it&rsquo;s an appartment building &hellip; devil city!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s all goverment&rsquo;s fault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I went into it, I noticed that she&rsquo;s not just ranting to me.
Yes, she did complain,
but she was genuine and kind and just felt like discussing life with a random person on the street.
I couldn&rsquo;t participate much in the conversation, so I just tried to listen,
understand her way of thinking and appreciate her honesty and willing to talk to me.
I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed any of that if I continued trying to fing my way.</p>
<p>At the end she told me that someone asked her to buy sausages, which she hates
and that her friend&rsquo;s ex-partner doesn&rsquo;t give her money for the kids.
Whether it&rsquo;s the the same friend who&rsquo;s problems she didn&rsquo;t want to disclose before, I don&rsquo;t know.
Then she said that she shouldn&rsquo;t speak anymore and that she needs to go home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God gave us a chance to meet&rdquo;,
she said before saying goodbye.<br>
&ldquo;Indeed&rdquo;,
I thought, and said my goodbyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fascinating how easily old people can just speak with strangers on the street.
I wish I could learn the same skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should write about this in my morning pages!&rdquo;<br>
Thanks grandma. God save you.</p>
