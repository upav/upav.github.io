    <p>For the first post here I thought, I&rsquo;ll go thru how and why I started writing and how it led me to creating this website.</p>
<p>Writing came into my life quite recently, couple of years ago, I would say.
It was when a lot of my friends started to create personal telegram channels, I thought <em>&ldquo;Wow! This is so cool, I could do the same but don&rsquo;t really know what to write about&hellip;&rdquo;</em>.
Then during some depressive periods of my life, when I had problems understanding what exactly I feel and why I feel that way.
That was the first time the pen and paper came to the rescue!
I started asking myself questions and writing bullet point with anything that comes up.
It was the first time writing allowed me to take a step back and look at the inifinitely confusing world of me.
It worked quite well as an &ldquo;energency reflection&rdquo; mechanism the few times I used it, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough for me to start writing yet..</p>
<p>This is where my friend Vlad came and told me that he&rsquo;ll be starting a blog.
At that time I thought it&rsquo;s a bad idea, maybe because I was scared of writing myself or maybe because I didn&rsquo;t understand all the beauties of blogging.
In any case, I didn&rsquo;t give him much support, even though I should have, I understand it now.
So even if I haven&rsquo;t started writing yet, I had a new word planted into my head.</p>
<p>Some months later I suddenly realised that I already have a blog! At work.
We have an internal &ldquo;blog&rdquo; space for writing documentation within a company and to share our knowledge and opinions.
Every time I had to create a page I would invest a lot of effort into making it cool.
I&rsquo;d think of a cool heading, pick up images I&rsquo;m gonna use and come up with jokes I&rsquo;m gonna put in there.
It was a great way to express myself and I enjoyed it every time I had a chance.
So I was already a blogger, just mostly technical and my blog was only visible to my colleagues.
I guess everyone starts somewhere, haha.</p>
<p>The last thing that made my mind was an <em><strong>Artist&rsquo;s way</strong></em> book/programm.
My friend suggested me to join their group reading the book and doing weekly catch-ups.
I won&rsquo;t go into the details of the book, just say that I do recomend it.
Julia Cameron, look her up.
As part of the program, you have to promise yourself that you will write 3 pages of text every morning for 3 months.<br>
Now that sounded terrifying!<br>
Like every day? My life is not that interesting! I won&rsquo;t have anything to write about!<br>
Still, something inside me felt like I need to take the challenge, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Fast forward 2 months, here I am, creating a blog because I wrote so many interesting reflections, I don&rsquo;t wanna lose them in the endless streams of consciousness in my notebooks.
So what happened between <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too scared to write&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;I have so my writings on paper, I need to digitise some of them so I don&rsquo;t lose my thoughts&rdquo;</em>?</p>
<p>Apparently, there&rsquo;s no wrong way to write a diary/journal/morning pages (call it however you like)!
Which sounds kinda easy and obvious but only before you actually sit down and start writing on a regular basis.
I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of some specific ways a lot of us are raised or it&rsquo;s just a fundamental way of our brain working, but we really like to create rules!
For no apparent reason. We think that whatever we create has to be in a particular way.
Everyone has their own opinions about how whatever they bring into this world should be like.
With time, daily writing hepled me to dissosiate some of those preconceptions and let me think and write without filtering the information.
No filer is needed because my pages don&rsquo;t have to be anything in particular!</p>
<p>Another thing I had to face on my way was the fear&hellip; Fear of not having anything to write about.
Luckly, this has also been disappearing the more I wrote.
The number of times I sat in my chair in the morning thinking I have nothing to write about and wrote all my pages with a great passion is astounishing.
I still have days when I think I won&rsquo;t have much to write about but now I know that I need to sit down and start writing anyway!
Quite often I find that as I start writing, next thing just appears in my mind as I write the previous one, then another one&hellip;
The truth is, we are always thinking about something. Constantly.
Why can&rsquo;t I write my thoughts even if they don&rsquo;t mean much or are <em>&ldquo;not worthy or writing down&rdquo;</em>?
With time, you start to notice that all these things are not so random, at least not in a sense you would think they are.
The contents of our thoughts or the way they come up in can usualy tell us a lot about our feelings.
So when you are practicing seeing your unfiltered thoughts, you&rsquo;re actually looking at your emotions and feelings.
And just like I did earlier with using bullet points for explaining my emotional states, I&rsquo;m now using morning pages to better understand my usual states.
There&rsquo;s something about structure here. When you need to put things on paper, you need to put whatever you feel into words and some sort of sentences.
Quite often, for that you need to take a step back and ask yourself some quesitons, whether counsciously or subconsciously.</p>
<p>The more pages I wrote, the more honest I could be with myself.
I could get even deeper into my emotions, which opened a whole other door of seeing myself in the way I haven&rsquo;t before.
Soon enough, I started seeing difference in my life outside the pages.
I&rsquo;ve started feeling more intimate with myself and other people.
I was able to see my insecurities for what they are and didn&rsquo;t need other people to give me reassuarance, which I hope made their time with me a bit more pleasant.
I say that, I don&rsquo;t actually think I&rsquo;ve figured out all my insecurities but defenetely some of them.<br>
That&rsquo;s where the daily writing got me in a couple of months.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s been happening to this day.
The thought of being able to put some of my reflections and stories somewhere where I can easily access them and share with other people been occupying me for the last couple of weeks.
This time I knew I needed a blog.
Even if no one reads it, it&rsquo;s there for myself.
Luckly for me, my friend Vlad already went through the process of creating a blog and wrote a <a href="https://vladisl0th.github.io/blog/0.helloworld/">blog post</a> about it!
If you are interested, give it a read, it&rsquo;s a relatively easy way to setup your blog/website and host it for free.
It will require being somewhat comfortable with the command line, basic knowledge of git/github, being curious and brave!<br>
Why not give it a try? I can help you if you want.</p>
<p>Love all, see you next time.</p>
