      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first post here I thought, I&amp;rsquo;ll go thru how and why I started writing and how it led me to creating this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing came into my life quite recently, couple of years ago, I would say.
It was when a lot of my friends started to create personal telegram channels, I thought &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wow! This is so cool, I could do the same but don&amp;rsquo;t really know what to write about&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.
Then during some depressive periods of my life, when I had problems understanding what exactly I feel and why I feel that way.
That was the first time the pen and paper came to the rescue!
I started asking myself questions and writing bullet point with anything that comes up.
It was the first time writing allowed me to take a step back and look at the inifinitely confusing world of me.
It worked quite well as an &amp;ldquo;energency reflection&amp;rdquo; mechanism the few times I used it, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough for me to start writing yet..&lt;/p&gt;</description>
